                    I was born in Canary Islands sometime around 1990. I crossed the ocean to
                    study Computer Science and Mathematics in Madrid, and eventually did an exchange
                    year at EPFL, Switzerland. This inevitably led to a Master's Degree in Computer
                    Science at said university, during which I had fun working on programming languages
                    and big data. I moved to Zurich for my dream job in 2016.

                    Then came the Plot Twist: I was diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder. It got so bad
                    that I had to stop working in 2017, and I haven't been able to go back ever since.
                    My illness is very resistant to treatment, and it has been a long and painful
                    journey. I'm very open an unashamed about it, and you can read more about it in my
                    <a routerLink="/blog">blog</a>.

                I identify as agender. I feel some connection to gender, but it is faint and not a big
                part of my life or identity. If gender is ice cream, I'm vanilla. On the internet I use
                they/them. If you want to know more about my journey into queerness, you can read about
                it in my <a routerLink="/blog">blog</a>.
